<h2>The Story</h2>
On August 10 at 6:30 p.m., members of the community will get together in the Village of Shepherd to enjoy a dinner cooked by local chefs using food that was grown locally. The event is a fundraiser for the St. Vincent De Paul Food Pantry in Shepherd.
<h2>How to Attend</h2>
Tickets are $25 per person, and they are being sold at different Shepherd businesses. These include Mitchell’s Gourmet Deli &amp; Market, Marrita’s, and Shepherd Bar &amp; Restaurant. Or, you can purchase the tickets from any of the committee members.
<h2>Wait, there’s more . . .</h2>
Because in addition to the really great food, Tinkers Folly will be playing as a part of the Entertainment starting at 6 p.m. Dinner will be served at 6:30 p.m.

There will also be a Silent Auction, door-prize drawings, and toe-tapping.
<h2>How to help out</h2>
There are lots of opportunities to help out. The Farm to Table committee is still looking for:
