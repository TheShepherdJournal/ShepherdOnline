Do you have news, an event, or a story that you would like to share with the community? The Shepherd Journal can help you get the word out.

The link below will take you to a Google Slides file where you can start a new slide and then add any relevant information. If you have a poster or flyer started already, you can link to it from a slide. I'l turn submissions into articles, and others will be able to see your information in the slideshow.

Please include your name and conta<span class="text_exposed_show">ct information, so that I can follow up with you. Events should include start and end times, location, and any costs.</span>
<div class="text_exposed_show">

Or, feel free to send a message to the page either via Facebook message or by sending an email to editor@shepherdhistory.org.

The Shepherd Journal's website now features a Calendar of Events, Classifieds, and business directory. Information posted on the site will be released in a weekly publication that can be easily read on the computer or downloaded and printed.
