<h5>What is the Party in the Park?</h5>
The Party in the Park is a little like the Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival, only with a much smaller scale. Instead of taking place all around the village, it is happening inside the Shepherd Community Memorial Park, and it will take place for two days: August 12 and 13.
<h5>What kind of events will there be?</h5>
A number of events are planned for the Party in the Park: Beer tent, Cornhole, a community picnic, demolition derby, and perfomances by several bands or musical groups.
<h5>What is the cost?</h5>
After five o'clock, admission to the park will be $5. Kids 12 or under will be admitted for free. Â The Demolition Derby will cost $5 for admission.
