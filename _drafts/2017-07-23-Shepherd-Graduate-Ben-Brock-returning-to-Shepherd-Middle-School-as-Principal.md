<p>Shepherd Middle School’s new principal, Ben Brock, will be a familiar face to the community. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jgross811">Jay Gross </a>wrote about Brock’s appointment as SMS principal on his facebook page:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hey There Shepherd...</p>
<p>A Blue Jay at heart, mind, and soul is coming home...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/benbrock8?fref=mentions">Ben Brock</a> is returning to Shepherd as middle school principal!</p>
<p>After being principal for about 14 years combined at Port Huron and Carson City Crystal, Ben will bring his family and all that Blue Jay pride back to the nest...</p>
<p>While I was talking to him, he said something that really got me... touched my heart...</p>
<p>"You know G... I have been at two places and keep trying to turn them into Shepherd... make them like home. It just doesn't work. There is no place like Shepherd anywhere else."</p>
<p>Ben is right. There isn't.</p>
<p>So happy and proud to have Ben and his whole family coming home…</p>
<p></p>
<p>According to Brock’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/benbrock8">Facebook profile</a>, he graduated from Shepherd High School in 1996, then graduated from Central Michigan University with a  degree in Health and Physical Education in 2001.</p>
